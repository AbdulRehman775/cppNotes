# Bitwise Operators

<p> Bitwise operators are used for managing data at bits level through C++ programming Language. There are 6 types of bitwise operators . </p>

# And operator & :

This operators uses And truth table and compares two numbers placed besides it and turn them into binary numbers and perform And operations on them.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
cout << a&b ;
```
# Or operator |

This operators uses OR truth table and compares two numbers placed besides it and turn them into binary numbers and perform OR operations on them.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
cout << a|b ;
```

# Not Operator ~ 

This Operators turn the number into number of bits and performs Not function on them 

```cpp
int a = 5;
cout << ~a ;
```

# Bitwise XOR 

It performs XOR operation on number of bits that is that it returns true if both bits are equal otherwise returns false.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
cout << a^b ;
```

# Left Shift operator  <<
This shifts the bit toward the left side. 
Like in **cout**   we shift the bits to the output stream.

# Right shift Operator >>

Shifts the bit from left to right
